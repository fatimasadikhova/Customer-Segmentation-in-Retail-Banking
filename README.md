# Customer Segmentation in Retail Banking
# Project Description
This project aims to segment retail banking customers into meaningful groups using unsupervised machine learning techniques. The goal is to help banks better understand their customers to improve marketing strategies, product recommendations, and customer engagement.

# Project goals
Data Loading and Cleaning: Successfully loaded the banking dataset, handled missing values, encoded categorical features, and normalized numerical columns.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed key customer features such as age, balance, job, marital status, and call duration to identify patterns.

Clustering: Implemented K-Means clustering, determined the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method, and segmented customers into distinct groups.

Dimensionality Reduction and Visualization: Applied PCA to reduce data dimensionality and visualized clusters in 2D space using scatter plots.

Business Insights: Interpreted clusters and identified customer profiles, such as high-value or low-engagement groups, to suggest targeted marketing strategies.

# Tools & Technologies used:
•	Programming Language: Python

•	Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
